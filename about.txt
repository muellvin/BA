### ABOUT ###
This program was written by Nino Hasler  and Vinzenz MÃ¼ller as Bachelor's Thesis at ETH Zurich, Chair of Steel and Composite Structures.
For more detail about what we did and how our tool works, check our Thesis Paper or the Documentation.
This program works with EBPlate. How EBPlate needs to be set up is written in setup.txt.
